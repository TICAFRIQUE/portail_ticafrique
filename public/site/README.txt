# Netic (Bootstrap 5 upgrade)
- Bootstrap upgraded to v5.3 (via CDN).
- jQuery and old plugins removed.
- Carousels and navbar attributes updated (data-bs-*).
- Utility classes updated (ml-auto -> ms-auto).
- All internal links kept as relative and point to existing pages.

Tip: Put your images under `images/` or edit the `<img>` `src` paths accordingly.
